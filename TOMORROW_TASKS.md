# 📅 Plan for Tomorrow

## 1. 🧠 Brain Transplants (Gemini 3 Upgrade)
*Complete the upgrade of key executive agents to the new "Thinking" models.*

- [x] **Optimizer Agent**: Upgraded to `gemini-3-flash-preview` (Done).
- [x] **CEO Agent**: Update model from `gemini-3-pro` to `gemini-3-pro-preview`.
- [x] **CTO Agent**: Update model from `gemini-3-pro` to `gemini-3-pro-preview`.
- [x] **Tech Lead**: Upgrade from `gemini-2.0-flash` to `gemini-3-flash-preview` (Coding reasoning).

## 2. 💰 Operation: One Dollar (Phase 8)
*Resume the revenue generation challenge.*

- [ ] **Verify End-to-End Flow**: Run the full challenge scenario.
- [ ] **Agent Coordination**: Ensure the upgraded CEO/Sales agents can actually execute the sales logic.
- [ ] **Stripe/Payment Verification**: Confirm the payment link generation tool works with the new agent models.

## 3. 📚 Documentation Hygiene
*Maintain the "Single Source of Truth" as requested.*

- [ ] **Sync AGENTS.md**: Ensure any agent model changes are reflected immediately.
- [ ] **Review SPEC.md**: Verify it matches the actual code state (specifically the Agent Layer section).

## 4. 🧹 Cleanup
- [x] Delete temporary debug scripts (`diagnose_gemini.js`, `test_optimizer_model.js`) if no longer needed.
