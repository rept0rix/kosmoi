# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Kosmoi Service Hub
**Generated by:** Requirements Agent
**Date:** 2025-12-11
**Version:** 1.0 (Swarm Generated)

## 1. Executive Summary
Kosmoi is an AI-native Service Hub where users can hire "Autonomous Agents" to perform real-world tasks (coding, booking, research). The platform provides a "Board Room" interface where the user acts as the Chairman, collaborating with a team of specialized agents.

## 2. Core Features (Implemented)
Based on `system_map.json` scan:

### 2.1 The Board Room (`src/pages/BoardRoom.jsx`)
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time chat with multi-agent support.
- **Orchestration**: `BoardOrchestrator` decides which agent speaks next.
- **Local Brain**: Support for completely local inference (privacy-focused).
- **Tools**: Agents can use tools like `calendar-api`, `payment-gateway`.

### 2.2 Autonomous Worker (`scripts/agent_worker.js`)
- A distributed worker system that allows agents to execute long-running tasks (e.g., coding, shell commands) outside the browser's main thread.

### 2.3 Vendor Lite (`src/pages/VendorLite.jsx`)
- A mobile-first dashboard for human service providers to accept/decline leads generated by agents.

## 3. User Stories
1.  **As a User**, I want to open the Board Room and chat with a Tech Lead agent to write a script.
2.  **As a User**, I want to see a "UX Heatmap" of my design, generated by a Vision Agent.
3.  **As a Vendor**, I want to receive booking requests on my phone and approve them with one tap.

## 4. Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (Fast, Client-side).
- **Database**: Supabase (Realtime, Auth, Vector DB).
- **AI**: Gemini (Cloud) + WebLLM (Local).
- **State Management**: React Hooks (`useBoardRoom`) + Supabase Realtime.

## 5. Upcoming Roadmap (Gap Analysis)
*   **Core Loop**: Move from reactive "Chat" to proactive "Infinite Loop" (BabyAGI style).
*   **Memory**: Implement Vector Search for long-term agent memory.
*   **Billing**: Connect Mock Wallet to real Stripe/Payment implementation.
