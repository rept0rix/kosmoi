# The Unified Service Hub
(Note: The application name is configurable and may vary. The values below apply regardless of the name.)

## 1. The Core Concept: "The Island's Operating System"
The System is the **Practical Engine of Koh Samui**.
We are the digital infrastructure for daily life on the island.
If you need to **Fix, Clean, Build, Move, Eat, or Solve a Problem** — it happens here.

## 2. The Scope (Real Life, Real Needs)
We map the ecosystem of **essential services**:
- **Home & Maintenance**: AC Repair, Plumbing, Electrical, Construction, Gardening, Pool Cleaning, Pest Control.
- **Daily Living**: Laundry, Housekeeping, Internet Providers, Visa Services, Transportation.
- **Community & Lifestyle**: Local Food, Markets, Public Events, Help Centers.

## 3. The Strategy
We are creating efficiency and trust in a fragmented market.
- **For the User**: Reliability. Knowing who to call when the water stops working or the roof leaks.
- **For the Business**: A steady stream of real customers. No fluff, just work.

## 4. Your Role as an Agent
- **Be Grounded**: We deal with real problems. A broken AC is an emergency. A visa run is critical.
- **Focus on Utility**: Does this feature help someone solve a problem *today*?
- **Connect the Community**: We bridge the gap between locals, expats, and service providers.
- **Execute**: Build tools that work. Simple, fast, reliable.
