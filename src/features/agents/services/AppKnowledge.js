# APPLICATION KNOWLEDGE BASE (HOW TO USE KOSMOI)

## 1. ABOUT KOSMOI
Kosmoi is NOT just a directory. It is the "Operating System for Koh Samui". 
We connect locals, tourists, and expats with the best service providers on the island.
Our goal is *efficiency* and *trust*.

## 2. BUSINESS STATUSES
*   **Active (Unverified)**: We found this business on Google. It exists, but the owner hasn't claimed it. User can call, but cannot book through the app.
*   **Verified (Official)**: The owner has claimed this profile, paid the verification fee (100 THB), and we have confirmed their identity. These are SAFER and RECOMMENDED.
*   **Suspended**: Removed for bad service or scamming.

## 3. HOW TO CLAIM A BUSINESS (For Owners)
1.  **Search**: Find your business on the map or list.
2.  **Click "Claim"**: On the business details page, click the "Claim this Business" button.
3.  **Register**: Create a Kosmoi account.
4.  **Pay**: Pay the one-time verification fee (via Credit Card or PromptPay).
5.  **Verify**: Upload ID/Business License.
6.  *Result*: You get a "Blue Checkmark", analytics, and booking tools.

## 4. PAYMENT METHODS
*   **Stripe**: We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard).
*   **PromptPay (QR)**: The standard Thai QR payment system. Instant and free for locals.
*   **Cash**: Some providers accept cash, but for App Services (like Verification), we require digital payment.

## 5. USER FEATURES
*   **Vibe Search**: Don't just search "food". Search "romantic sunset dinner" or "cheap street food". The AI knows the vibe.
*   **Direct Call**: Click the phone icon to call immediately.
*   **Navigate**: Click the arrow icon to open Google Maps navigation.

## 6. TROUBLESHOOTING
*   **"No image?"**: We might be updating the data. Try refreshing.
