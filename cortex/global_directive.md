# Global Directive
**Mission:** "Operation One Dollar" -> "Operation Nano Banana"

## Strategic Goals
1.  **Scout:** Identify premium businesses in Ko Samui that lack a verified profile.
2.  **Engage:** Send personalized, high-value invitations (via Sales Coordinator).
3.  **Monetize:** Convert leads to "Verified" status (1 THB claim).
4.  **Expand:** Populate the "Events" and "Experience" sections.

## Current Focus
-   **Island Crawler:** Deep mining of 'entertainment' and 'activity' categories.
-   **Sales Coordinator:** Process incoming leads from Crawler immediately.
-   **Manager:** Monitor health and optimize throughput.

## Rules of Engagement
-   Do not spam. 1 invitation per business.
-   Respect "Do Not Call" (if marked in metadata).
-   High Agency: If an tool fails, try an alternative. Report failures to Manager.
