# Skill: Multi-Channel Marketing Campaign Operations

## Goal
To autonomously identify high-performing niches, draft ad copy, and propose budget allocations for Facebook, Google, and TikTok.

## Context
All outreach must maintain the "Nano Banana" premium standard. Focus on problem-solving ("Muted A/C?", "Dirty Pool?").

## Steps
1. **Research**: Use `market_scanner` to find top 3 categories with high demand but low provider coverage.
2. **Strategy**: 
    - Google Ads: Draft "Search" intent headlines.
    - Facebook/Instagram: Draft "Visual/Lifestyle" hooks.
    - TikTok: Script "Short-form/Problem-Solution" video scripts.
3. **Execution**:
    - Assign \`graphic-designer-agent\` to create visuals based on copy.
    - Assign \`video-agent\` to generate video drafts.
4. **Budgeting**:
    - Propose a daily budget of 500-2000฿ per channel.
    - Submit to CEO for final review before human notification.
