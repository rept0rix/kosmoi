Please create a .zip archive containing HTML, CSS, and Javascript files for three 'Smoke Test' landing pages. Each landing page should be designed to gauge interest in a specific service category (e.g., 'Luxury Villa Rentals', 'Private Chef Services', 'Personalized Wellness Retreats' on Koh Samui). The landing pages should have a clear headline, a brief description of the service, and a prominent call-to-action button (e.g., 'Learn More', 'Get a Quote', 'Book Now') that leads to a simple form requesting contact information (name, email, phone number, and a short text field for describing their specific needs). Prioritize clean and responsive design. The HTML, CSS, and Javascript should be well-organized and commented.
